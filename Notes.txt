Tap Parser (TP)
- Track accelerometer input
- Process data
- Stream data to MP if activation command is recognized
- Use default polling frequency in standby mode, switch to high speed polling when activated?

- - How to distinguish taps?
- - - A spike of accel, possibly followed by a rebound?
- - - How to distinguish a tap from the space between taps?
- - - How to distinguish a dash from a dot?

-----

Morse Parser (MP)
- Receive tap data from TP
- Parse as morse code, via the length of taps and the spaces between them
- If a command is recognized stream data from that command (inclusive) to HQ

- - Tapping will not be perfectly uniform, or even consistant. How to allow for natural variation?
